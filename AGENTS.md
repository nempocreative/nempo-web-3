## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

## Architecture rules
- Organization moment portfolios keep fictional content in browser-safe data, use a scoped global theme and a metadata leaf route mounting NempoShell, give each member their own standalone AI portrait (generated with their group-photo likeness as reference), and reuse the shared session-only wall validator; why: keep identity, category navigation, and honest message behavior consistent.
- Event moment portfolios follow the same pattern (browser-safe data, scoped `.me-page` theme, metadata leaf route mounting NempoShell, shared session-only wall validator) and present the after-movie as a photo slideshow driven by a tested wrap-around helper that never autoplays under reduced motion; committee members get standalone AI portraits; why: no real event footage exists and motion must respect user settings.
- Community moment portfolios follow the same pattern (browser-safe data, scoped `.mkt-page` theme, metadata leaf route mounting NempoShell, shared session-only wall validator); the member-growth chart and current member count derive from the yearly data through tested helpers, and each organizer has a standalone AI portrait; why: the headline numbers must always agree with the year-by-year story.
- Special-greeting (Ucapan Spesial) portfolios keep all three greeting variants in one browser-safe data module with tested age, candle and wall helpers, switch theme via `data-tema` on the scoped `.mus-page`, and open behind an envelope; their Instagram feed version (3 slides, 1080×1350) takes its text from `src/data/ucapan-feed.ts` and is drawn by the lazily loaded `src/lib/ucapan-feed-canvas.ts`, whose PNG is both preview and download; why: one page shows several occasions without duplicating layout, the feed slides never disagree with the letter, and the age never drifts from the birth date.
- Public community applications must pass database-side field validation; site settings are admin-only, and public ticket reads require both an active ticket and an active parent event; why: direct Data API requests must not bypass form validation or reveal unpublished records.
- Friendship moment portfolios use browser-safe data, a scoped global CSS theme, a dedicated metadata leaf route mounting NempoShell, and the shared wall-message validator with session-only messages; scene variations use the same generated group photo as an edit reference and each member has a standalone AI portrait made from their likeness, never a crop; why: category content stays consistent, faces remain recognizable, and previews never pretend to save messages publicly.
- Interactive yearbook memories use a focused browser-only UI and shared tested helpers; time capsules persist only in local device storage with downloadable backups, and sample farewell video uses the existing AI school photos; why: examples must work without pretending to send private letters or provide real class footage.
- Personal yearbook features use shared tested voting and quiz helpers; demo votes stay device-local, dream groups reference existing student aspirations, and Story cards are drawn on a canvas (`src/lib/story-card-canvas.ts`, loaded lazily) whose PNG is both the preview and the download; why: keep sample content honest, keep browser-only code out of SSR, and make the saved file match the preview on every browser including iOS.
- The whole NEMPO site (main pages and `/cms`; the Nempo Feed tool was later removed at the owner's request so the project holds only the organizer site) was migrated from nempocreative/nempo-web (originally nempocreative/remix-of-remix-of-remix-of-remix-of-nempo-feed-migration-4); its schema was rebuilt from the old generated types and is recorded in `docs/schema-baseline/` (0000 full schema, 0001 visitor privileges, 0002 yearbook photo submissions, 0003 selected public-access policy fixes); why: the source repo carried no migrations, so those files are the schema of record.
- The Drizzle migration set was reset to empty after each remix because the remixed database already holds the full schema from `docs/schema-baseline/`; every new migration must only add or change things; why: re-running the baseline would fail on existing tables.
- CMS admins are granted only by the `on_auth_user_confirmed_grant_admin` trigger when a verified email matches `admin_allowlist`, or by an existing admin; the CMS login offers activate (sign up + verify) and password reset; why: migrated admins get new auth IDs and must prove email ownership before receiving access.
- Media pointers under `src/assets/` must belong to this project's own storage (re-upload with `lovable-assets create` when bringing files from another project); why: a foreign project's pointer breaks once published.
- Page-level routing inside the NEMPO app goes through `src/lib/wouter.tsx`, a wouter-compatible API backed by TanStack Router; why: keeps one router without rewriting every page. New pages are added to the `Switch` in `src/nempo-app.tsx`.
- tsconfig strict extras (noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, etc.) are off; why: the imported code was written without them.
- Lazily loaded pages and apps use `lazyWithRetry` from `src/lib/lazy-with-retry.ts` instead of React `lazy`; why: a page file that fails to load after an update otherwise blanks the whole screen — it retries once, then reloads once. Do not call preventDefault on Vite's `vite:preloadError`; it makes the import resolve empty and React crashes with a blank screen.
- Lock CMS and backup pages off published domains (preview only); why: owner wants only the organizer site live. Implemented in src/lib/hosting-lock.ts via Start request middleware.
- Program proposals (`/program/<slug>`) list in browser-safe `src/data/program.ts`; each deck's slides live under `src/program/<slug>/` sized with container units (cqw/cqh) inside a 16:9 `.psg-stage`, load lazily only after the access code is accepted by a server function whose codes stay in `src/lib/program-access.server.ts`; why: imported Replit slide decks keep their exact layout at any screen size and the code never ships to browsers (the slide files themselves are still public, so this is a light lock, not strong secrecy).
- Some subdirectories have their own `AGENTS.md` (`src/apps/`); read the nearest one before changing files there; why: those rules are scoped to that folder.
